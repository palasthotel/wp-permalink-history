Saves the history of your WordPress site and provides automatic redirects.

== Description ==

Saves the history of your WordPress site and provides automatic redirects.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= How does it work? =

This plugin tries to save all changes of permalinks in your system. When someone uses an old permalink that is in the history database it will not show 404 page but instead redirect to the new location.

= Does this work with changes made before plugin installation? =

Nobe! You need to first install this plugin to start saving the history.

= Does this effect my site performance? =

For small sites (less than 30.000 posts) there should be no performance issue. We use a custom table with good indexation to provide quick search access for historical permalinks.

But to be honest. Perhaps it could get an issue, yes. Therefore you export a redirect map on the permalinks settings page and make early redirects before php starts working.
