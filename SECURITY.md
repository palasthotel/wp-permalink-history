## Reporting a Vulnerability

When reporting a vulnerability, you can use GitHub's “Private Vulnerability Reporting”. Just navigate to the Open an Issue page and choose “Report a security vulnerability”. This way, maintainers will privately notified first. Afterwards, in a best-case scenario, if the vulnerability is fixed, the report will be made public.
